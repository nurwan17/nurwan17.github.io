        "abstract": "COVID-19 presents an urgent global challenge because of its contagious nature, frequently changing characteristics, and the lack of a vaccine or effective medicines. A model for measuring and preventing the continued spread of COVID-19 is urgently required to provide smart health care services. This requires using advanced intelligent computing such as artificial intelligence, machine learning, deep learning, cognitive computing, cloud computing, fog computing, and edge computing. This paper proposes a model for predicting COVID-19 using the SIR and machine learning for smart health care and the well-being of the citizens of KSA. Knowing the number of susceptible, infected, and recovered cases each day is critical for mathematical modeling to be able to identify the behavioral effects of the pandemic. It forecasts the situation for the upcoming 700 days. The proposed system predicts whether COVID-19 will spread in the population or die out in the long run. Mathematical analysis and simulation results are presented here as a means to forecast the progress of the outbreak and its possible end for three types of scenarios: \u201cno actions,\u201d \u201clockdown,\u201d and \u201cnew medicines.\u201d The effect of interventions like lockdown and new medicines is compared with the \u201cno actions\u201d scenario. The lockdown case delays the peak point by decreasing the infection and affects the area equality rule of the infected curves. On the other side, new medicines have a significant impact on infected curve by decreasing the number of infected people about time. Available forecast data on COVID-19 using simulations predict that the highest level of cases might occur between 15 and 30 November 2020. Simulation data suggest that the virus might be fully under control only after June 2021. The reproductive rate shows that measures such as government lockdowns and isolation of individuals are not enough to stop the pandemic. This study recommends that authorities should, as soon as possible, apply a strict long-term containment strategy to reduce the epidemic size successfully",

        "abstract": "There is a growing interest on social networks for topics related to Healthcare. In particular, on Twitter, millions of tweets related to healthcare can be found. These posts contain public opinions on health, and allow to understand how is the popular perception on topics such as medical diagnosis, medicines, facilities, and claims. In this paper we present an adaptive system designed using 5 layers. The system contains a combination of unsupervised and supervised algorithms to track the trends of health social media. As it is based on a word2vec model, it also captures the correlation of words based on the context, improving over time, enhancing the accuracy of predictions and tweet tracking. In this work we focused on United States data and use it to detect the trending topics of each state. These topics are followed including new social network contributions. The supervised algorithm implemented is a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) in conjunction with the Word2Vect model to classify and label new tweets, assigning a feedback to the topic models. The results of this algorithm present an accuracy of 83.34%, precision of 83%, recall 84% and F-Score of 83.8% when evaluated. Our results are compared with two state of the art techniques demonstrating an advantage that can be leveraged for further improvements.",

        "abstract": "We propose a data-driven machine learning model to predict the likelihood of a person being vaccinated against H1N1 and seasonal flu. In 2009, a pandemic that was caused by the H1N1 influenza virus, named \"swine flu\", spread like wildfire across the world.

A vaccine against the H1N1 (swine flu) virus was made available in October 2009. We have implemented 9 machine learning models. The models include MlBox (model1), TPOT (model 2), Random forest (model 3), MLP (model 4), Linear regression, (model 5), Decision trees (model 6), polynomial feature (model 7), XgBoost (model 8) and CatBoost (model 9). Out of these 9 models, CatBoost gave the best performance with an accuracy of 0.8617 followed by the XgBoost and MlBox. Hence, this study showed that cast boost gave the best performance of all the models and can be used for further prediction models in this category.",

        "abstract": "Multiple studies in recent literature have shown that human mobility has a considerable effect on the importation of dengue to an immunologically dengue \u2018naive\u2019 regions. The purpose of this study is to validate whether this fact is applicable to dengue endemic regions as well as assess the impact of human mobility when developing predictive models for dengue incidence of a particular geographical region. The information regarding human population mobility of Sri Lanka was derived using Mobile Network Big Data (MNBD) due to its better representativity and accuracy over other conventional data sources such as census data or surveys. The derived mobility values for each region of the country is then weighted using reported past dengue cases of the relevant region. We used Artificial Neural Networks and XGBoost to predict the dengue incidence for selected administrative regions within Western Province of Sri Lanka. Accuracy of the prediction for dengue incidence improved on average when considering all the administrative regions included in our study by incorporating weighted human mobility. Our study shows that there is an impact of human mobility on the spread of Dengue fever in Sri Lanka while introducing a generalizable methodology to fuse big data sources with traditional data sources in developing predictive models using machine learning techniques.",

        "abstract": "Background In China, dengue remains an important public health issue with expanded areas and increased incidence recently. Accurate and timely forecasts of dengue incidence in China are still lacking. We aimed to use the state-of-the-art machine learning algorithms to develop an accurate predictive model of dengue.   Methodology/Principal findings Weekly dengue cases, Baidu search queries and climate factors (mean temperature, relative humidity and rainfall) during 2011\u20132014 in Guangdong were gathered. A dengue search index was constructed for developing the predictive models in combination with climate factors. The observed year and week were also included in the models to control for the long-term trend and seasonality. Several machine learning algorithms, including the support vector regression (SVR) algorithm, step-down linear regression model, gradient boosted regression tree algorithm (GBM), negative binomial regression model (NBM), least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) linear regression model and generalized additive model (GAM), were used as candidate models to predict dengue incidence. Performance and goodness of fit of the models were assessed using the root-mean-square error (RMSE) and R-squared measures. The residuals of the models were examined using the autocorrelation and partial autocorrelation function analyses to check the validity of the models. The models were further validated using dengue surveillance data from five other provinces. The epidemics during the last 12 weeks and the peak of the 2014 large outbreak were accurately forecasted by the SVR model selected by a cross-validation technique. Moreover, the SVR model had the consistently smallest prediction error rates for tracking the dynamics of dengue and forecasting the outbreaks in other areas in China.   Conclusion and significance The proposed SVR model achieved a superior performance in comparison with other forecasting techniques assessed in this study. The findings can help the government and community respond early to dengue epidemics.",

        "abstract": "In November 2019, the coronavirus disease outbreak began, caused by the novel severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2. In just over two months, the unprecedented rapid spread resulted in more than 10,000 confirmed cases worldwide. This study predicted the infectious spread of coronavirus disease in the contiguous United States using a convolutional autoencoder with long short-term memory and compared its predictive performance with that of the convolutional autoencoder without long short-term memory. The epidemic data were obtained from the World Health Organization and the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention from January 1st to April 6th, 2020. We used data from the first 366,607 confirmed cases in the United States. In this study, the data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention were gridded by latitude and longitude and the grids were categorized into six epidemic levels based on the number of confirmed cases. The input of the convolutional autoencoder with long short-term memory was the distribution of confirmed cases 14\u00a0days before, whereas the output was the distribution of confirmed cases 7\u00a0days after the date of testing. The mean square error in this model was 1.664, the peak signal-to-noise ratio was 55.699, and the structural similarity index was 0.99, which were better than those of the corresponding results of the convolutional autoencoder. These results showed that the convolutional autoencoder with long short-term memory effectively and reliably predicted the spread of infectious disease in the contiguous United States.",

        "abstract": "Objective Conventional risk stratification models for mortality of acute myocardial infarction (AMI) have potential limitations. This study aimed to develop and validate deep-learning-based risk stratification for the mortality of patients with AMI (DAMI).   Methods The data of 22,875 AMI patients from the Korean working group of the myocardial infarction (KorMI) registry were exclusively divided into 12,152 derivation data of 36 hospitals and 10,723 validation data of 23 hospitals. The predictor variables were the initial demographic and laboratory data. The endpoints were in-hospital mortality and 12-months mortality. We compared the DAMI performance with the global registry of acute coronary event (GRACE) score, acute coronary treatment and intervention outcomes network (ACTION) score, and the thrombolysis in myocardial infarction (TIMI) score using the validation data.   Results In-hospital mortality for the study subjects was 4.4% and 6-month mortality after survival upon discharge was 2.2%. The areas under the receiver operating characteristic curves (AUCs) of the DAMI were 0.905 [95% confidence interval 0.902\u20130.909] and 0.870 [0.865\u20130.876] for the ST elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) and non ST elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI) patients, respectively; these results significantly outperformed those of the GRACE (0.851 [0.846\u20130.856], 0.810 [0.803\u20130.819]), ACTION (0.852 [0.847\u20130.857], 0.806 [0.799\u20130.814] and TIMI score (0.781 [0.775\u20130.787], 0.593[0.585\u20130.603]). DAMI predicted 30.9% of patients more accurately than the GRACE score. As secondary outcome, during the 6-month follow-up, the high risk group, defined by the DAMI, has a significantly higher mortality rate than the low risk group (17.1% vs. 0.5%, p < 0.001).   Conclusions The DAMI predicted in-hospital mortality and 12-month mortality of AMI patients more accurately than the existing risk scores and other machine-learning methods.",

        "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Random Forests are an important model in machine learning. They are simple and very effective classification approach. The random forest identifies the most important features of a given problem. OBJECTIVES: The heart disease is cardiovascular disease, with a set of conditions affecting the heart. During heart disease, there will be heartbeat problems with congenital heart disorders and coronary artery defects. A coronary heart defect is a heart disease, which decreases the flow of blood to the heart. When the flow of blood decreases heart attack occurs. It is necessary to analyse the prediction of heart attack based on the symptoms. METHODS: The available data set of patients with heart defects symptoms is taken and analysed in this paper using the random forest and decision tree regression models. The missing data is updated using mean value of the attribute. Python language is used to predict the accuracy. RESULTS: Three performance measures are taken for analysing the available UCI Cleveland data set for heart disease. The performance measures are the Mean Absolute Error, Mean Squared Error and Root Mean Squared Error. Vital attributes of the data set are taken for analyses using the random forest regression model and decision tree regression model. The analyses shows that the slope attribute provides the better prediction for the heart disease. The results are shows that the females are more prone to heart attack. CONCLUSION: Prediction of heart disease using the UCI machine learning data set at Cleveland repository is analysed using random forest regression model and decision tree regression models. We find random forest regression model provides better accuracy than decision tree regression model.",

        "abstract": "Introduction: \"Social big data\" from technologies such as social media, wearable devices, and online searches continue to grow and can be used as tools for HIV research. Although researchers can uncover patterns and insights associated with HIV trends and transmission, the review process is time consuming and resource intensive. Machine learning methods derived from computer science might be used to assist HIV domain experts by learning how to rapidly and accurately identify patterns associated with HIV from a large set of social data. Methods: Using an existing social media data set that was associated with HIV and coded by an HIV domain expert, we tested whether 4 commonly used machine learning methods could learn the patterns associated with HIV risk behavior. We used the 10-fold cross-validation method to examine the speed and accuracy of these models in applying that knowledge to detect HIV content in social media data. Results and discussion: Logistic regression and random forest resulted in the highest accuracy in detecting HIV-related social data (85.3%), whereas the Ridge Regression Classifier resulted in the lowest accuracy. Logistic regression yielded the fastest processing time (16.98 seconds). Conclusions: Machine learning can enable social big data to become a new and important tool in HIV research, helping to create a new field of \"digital HIV epidemiology.\" If a domain expert can identify patterns in social data associated with HIV risk or HIV transmission, machine learning models could quickly and accurately learn those associations and identify potential HIV patterns in large social data sets.",
